\section{Introduction}

So you see actually materials can be made very tiny and it sucks because we dont knosw how to describe it when its smol (not to small tho, then we know, not too too small, then we dont knwo anymore). Sometimes its fluid, sometimes gassy, and no im not talking about my ass. Usually systems are at equilibrium but for small grains this is usually not true, so we shouldn't be able to apply dissipation-fluctuation. Yet, we do, because small balls do not care about the laws of physics. Ah also there is a forced oscillator that is actually damped and it should gives us how liquid or visquous the balls are. But it doesnt, because it does not care about the laws of physics.
