In terms of the frequency of the Cs133 hyperfine transition (F = 4, {mF} = 0) ↔(F = 3, {mF} = 0), defined as 9192 631 770 Hz, for the unperturbed hydrogen transition frequency the value υH = 1420 405 751.768 Hz is obtained. This result is the mean of two independent evaluations against the same cesium reference, which differ by 2 × 10-3 Hz. We estimate the one-sigma uncertainty of the value υH also to be 2 × 10-3 Hz. One evaluation is based on wall-shift experiments at Harvard University; the other is a result of a new wall-shift measurement using many storage bulbs of different sizes at the National Bureau of Standards. The experimental procedures and the applied corrections are described. Results for the wall shift and for the frequency of hydrogen are compared with previously published values, and error limits of the experiments are discussed.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            In this paper, we construct the circular velocity curve of the Milky Way out to ∼30 kpc, providing an updated model of the dark matter density profile. We derive precise parallaxes for 120 309 stars with a data-driven model, using {APOGEE} {DR}17 spectra combined with {GaiaDR}3, 2MASS, and {WISE} photometry. At outer galactic radii up to 30 kpc, we find a significantly faster decline in the circular velocity curve compared to the inner parts. This decline is better fit with a cored Einasto profile with a slope parameter \$0.91{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.05\}\$ than a generalized Navarro–Frenk–White ({NFW}) profile. The virial mass of the best-fitting dark matter halo profile is only \$1.81{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06\}\_\{-0.05\}{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M⊙, significantly lower than what a generalized {NFW} profile delivers. We present a study of the potential systematics, affecting mainly large radii. Such a low mass for the Galaxy is driven by the functional forms tested, given that it probes beyond our measurements. It is found to be in tension with mass measurements from globular clusters, dwarf satellites, and streams. Our best-fitting profile also lowers the expected dark matter annihilation signal flux from the galactic centre by more than an order of magnitude, compared to an {NFW} profile-fit. In future work, we will explore profiles with more flexible functional forms to more fully leverage the circular velocity curve and observationally constrain the properties of the Milky Way’s dark matter halo.},

            Glon sky survey is a data acquisition method of 21 cm neutral hydrogen spectrum. Recently, the author has conducted a series of studies on the data of the {gLon} sky survey. After transforming and analyzing the data, the author found that in the region of the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the linear velocity of galactic rotation increases with the distance away from the center. For the region 15 light-years away, the linear velocity of rotation remains almost unchanged. By transforming the variation of velocity with radius into the chart, it can be found that there are deviations in the early galactic rotation structure model. For the newly proposed combined Exponential and Isothermal model, there is a high degree of agreement. The model confirms that there is a huge dark matter halo at the outer edge of the Galaxy. The weak gravitational interaction between dark matter halo and visible matter affects the current rotational structure of the Galaxy.},

              Flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are considered as an evidence for dark matter, but the rotation curve of the Milky Way is difficult to measure. Various objects were used to track the rotation curve in the outer parts of the Galaxy, but most studies rely on incomplete kinematical information and inaccurate distances. Here, we use a sample of 773 Classical Cepheids with precise distances based on mid-infrared period–luminosity relations coupled with proper motions and radial velocities from
              Gaia
              to construct the accurate rotation curve of the Milky Way up to the distance of ∼20 kpc from the Galactic center. We use a simple model of Galactic rotation to measure the rotation speed of the Sun Θ
