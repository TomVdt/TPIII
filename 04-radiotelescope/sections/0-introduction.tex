\section{Introduction}
Ok so basically hydrogen electron spin sometimes goes flip (but only when he feels like, no pressure bro) and the flip is in the radio frequencies, at precisely 1.42 GHz.
If you steal your grandma's parabola and detect this signal you can check how far is the perceived flip frequence from what should be the actual flip frequence, then Doppler the hell out of it \cite{burke_introduction_2013}.
So yeah this is how we measured the relative speed of a galaxy with a piece of junk on the roof, cheers.
