\section{Theory and experimental setup}
\subsection{Coordinate systems}
When operating a radio telescope, three main coordinate systems are used to locate objects on the celestial sphere: \hl{citation ici pour "grouper" les trois points? Je n'ai utilisé que} \cite{carroll_introduction_2007}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Altitude-Azimuth} (Alt-Az) coordinate system is based on the observer's local horizon. The altitude $h$ is the angle measured from the horizon to the object along a circle which passes through the object itself and the point on the celestial sphere directly above the observer, i.e. the zenith. The azimuth $a$ is the angle measured along the horizon eastward from north to the circle used for the measure of altitude. \hl{Desavantages du système?} \cite{carroll_introduction_2007}
    \item The \textbf{Right Ascension-Declination} (Ra-Dec) coordinate system, also called \textbf{Equatorial}, is based on the latitude-longitude system of Earth, thus removing the dependency on the position of the observer, but does not participate in the planet's rotation. Declination $\delta$ is the equivalent of latitude and measured in degrees north or south of the celestial equator. Right ascension $\alpha$ is analogous to longitude and is measured eastward along the celestial equator from the vernal equinox, i.e. the position of the Sun at Spring equinox, to the object's hour circle, i.e. the circle passing throught the object and the north celestial pole.
    \item The \textbf{Galactic} coordinate system is often used when studying the structure and kinematics of the Milky Way, exploiting the natural symmetry introduced by the existance of the Galactic disk. The intersection of the midplane of the Galaxy with the celestial sphere defines the Galactic equator. Galactic latitude $b$ is measured north or south of the Galactic equator along a circle which passes through the North Galactic Pole. Galactic longitude $l$ is measured east along the Galactic equator, starting from near the Galactic center to the point of intersection with the circle used to measure the latitude.
\end{itemize}
[Knowledge of the observer's latitude and local time allows to convert between Alt-Az and Equatorial]
Starting from their definitions, spherical trigonometry allows to convert between Equatorial and Galactic coordinates: CHECK PAGE 900 OF \Cite{carroll_introduction_2007}

\subsection{Radio astronomy }
Sources of radio emission are of two possible forms, thermal and non-thermal.
Thermal is of two types blabla [one is the source of H 21 cm line]
Non-thermal is synchroton and geosynchrotron? radiation.

\paragraph{The H 21 cm line}
WHAT IS IT?
The spectral line radiation from neutral hydrogen gives the velocity and density of the interstellar medium \cite{burke_introduction_2013}.

The low hydrogen density ($\sim 1$ cm$^{-3}$) and long lifetime are compensated for by the very long lines of sight in the ISM (interstellar medium)\cite{burke_introduction_2013}.

\subsection{The VEGA Small Radio Telescope}

The receiving antenna of a radio telescope serves a dual purpose: it concentrates the weak signals from the sources (in such a way that they can then be processed by the electronics) and it selects the area of the sky from which the signal is to be received \cite{lauterbach_radio_2022}.
Parabolic reflectors are well suited for this purpose, concentrating the incident waves at the focal point, where the feed, i.e. WHAT IT IS, is placed.

Feeds take several forms, each suited to a certain frequency range \cite{lauterbach_radio_2022}. In the case of VEGA, a copper helix was installed, of dimensions BLABLA.

The signal then passes through a series of filters and amplifiers

Feed is an electronic circuit used to filter and amplify the desired band of frequencies (in our case blablabla).
Then blabla is used to convert the analog signal into digital and into computer.

[[In a radio telescope, the antenna usually points towards the sky with great eleva-
tion. Therefore, thermal radiation from the ground below can hit the feed from the
area outside the reflector (“spillover”, Fig. 3.5). The feed is therefore constructed
in such a way that it receives less well from the edge of the parabolic reflector than
from the centre.]]
