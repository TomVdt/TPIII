\section{Conclusion}

The experimental VEGA Small Radio Telescope was used to observe neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way through the measurement of the characteristic HI peak. 
A calibration of the telescope was first conducted using the Sun, determining that the antenna does not point towards the expected location, but rather $\Delta a = -(5.25 \pm 0.50)^\circ$, $\Delta h = -(2.70 \pm 0.10)^\circ$ from the target. 
After succesfully capturing red- and blueshifted HI peaks, a signal processing pipeline was established. 
By measuring the signal from a nearby building, a noise baseline was found, which was subsequently used to reduce noise in actual signals by dividing them by the noise. 
This allowed for the measurement of HI peaks at multiple galactic longitudes, from which the velocity curve of the Milky Way was determined using multiple methods. 
The same methods were also applied on measurements taken from \emph{Torre}, a SALSA telescope. 
From comparisons with the literature, it was determined that the general equation method yielded the best results, while the Oort method did not seem to apply well to the measurements. 
The lack of dependence of the velocity on the radius found using the general equation method supports the models of Galactic dynamics based on the presence of dark matter.   
Several shortcomings of the antenna and its operating software were identified, and improvements were suggested to broaden the possible range of observations.
