More complex geometries can be used, to reduce noise ETC\ldots \cite{burke_introduction_2013}

The velocities obtained with tangential are lower limit (EXPLAIN WHY), but those obtained with vector are lower so bruh.

Based on \cite{sakhawat_hossain_salsa_2018} it seems that the curve obtained in \autoref{fig:VEGA_velocity_curve} is characteristic of measures taken with $b \neq 0$. It could be the error in pointing of the telescope which is responsible: we were not actually pointing precisely at the galactic plane.
