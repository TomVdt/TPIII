In contrast to photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) with photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, dSTORM experiments start with bright fluorescent samples in which the fluorophores have to be transferred to a stable and reversible OFF state. The OFF state has a lifetime in the range of 100 milliseconds to several seconds after irradiation with light intensities low enough to ensure minimal photodestruction. Either spontaneously or photoinduced on irradiation with a second laser wavelength, a sparse subset of fluorophores is reactivated and their positions are precisely determined. Repetitive activation, localization and deactivation allow a temporal separation of spatially unresolved structures in a reconstructed image. Here we present a step-by-step protocol for dSTORM imaging in fixed and living cells on a wide-field fluorescence microscope, with standard fluorescent probes focusing especially on the photoinduced fine adjustment of the ratio of fluorophores residing in the ON and OFF states. Furthermore, we discuss labeling strategies, acquisition parameters, and temporal and spatial resolution. The ultimate step of data acquisition and data processing can be performed in seconds to minutes.},

The PSFs are expressed using the Debye integral. Under an L∞ constraint imposing peak matching, optimal and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With an L1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that (1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and nearly perfect for the LSCM.

              Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has generated tremendous success in revealing detailed subcellular structures in animal cells. However, its application to plant cell biology remains extremely limited due to numerous technical challenges, including the generally high fluorescence background of plant cells and the presence of the cell wall.

              seedling roots with a spatial resolution of 20–40 nm was demonstrated. Using the super-resolution images, the spatial organization of cortical microtubules in different parts of a whole Arabidopsis root tip was analyzed quantitatively and the results show the dramatic differences in the density and spatial organization of cortical microtubules in cells of different differentiation stages or types. The method developed can be applied to plant cell biological processes, including imaging of additional elements of the cytoskeleton, organelle substructure and membrane domains.},

abstract = {Microtubules are one of the three components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and play a central role in many aspects of cell function, including cell division and cell motility. Electron microscopy, of both isolated microtubules and of microtubules in their cellular context, is an essential tool in understanding their structure and function. These studies have been particularly important because the size and heterogeneity of microtubules mean that they are not readily studied by other structural methods. Electron microscopy at different levels of detail can bridge the gap between atomic resolution structures solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR, and the dynamic but relatively coarse information that is achieved in light microscopy experiments. This chapter provides an overview of current approaches to studying microtubules by electron microscopy. Negative stain studies can be relatively quick and easy, and provide a useful overview of microtubules and their interactions prior to undertaking more complicated experiments such as high resolution structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy or reconstruction of unique cellular entities by electron tomography. As more microtubule-associated proteins are uncovered, EM studies will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how these proteins influence microtubules and where in the cytoskeleton they act.}

Each probe consists of a photo-switchable “reporter” fluorophore that can be cycled between fluorescent and dark states, and an “activator” that facilitates photo-activation of the reporter. Combinatorial pairing of reporters and activators allows the creation of probes with many distinct colors. Iterative, color-specific activation of sparse subsets of these probes allows their localization with nanometer accuracy, enabling the construction of a super-resolution {STORM} image. Using this approach, we demonstrate multicolor imaging of {DNA} model samples and mammalian cells with 20- to 30-nanometer resolution. This technique will facilitate direct visualization of molecular interactions at the nanometer scale.},

	abstract = {Background
Studies of mitochondrial morphology vary in techniques. Most use one morphological parameter while others describe mitochondria qualitatively. Because mitochondria are so dynamic, a single parameter does not capture the true state of the network and may lead to erroneous conclusions. Thus, a gestalt method of analysis is warranted.

New Method
This work describes a method combining immunofluorescence assays with computerized image analysis to measure the mitochondrial morphology within neuritic projections of a specific population of neurons. Six parameters of mitochondrial morphology were examined utilizing {ImageJ} to analyze colocalized signals.

Results
Using primary neuronal cultures from Drosophila, we tested mitochondrial morphology in neurites of dopaminergic ({DA}) neurons. We validate our model using mutants with known defects in mitochondrial morphology. Furthermore, we show a difference in mitochondrial morphology between cells treated as control or with a neurotoxin inducing {PD} (Parkinson's Disease in humans)-like pathology. We also show interactions between morphological parameters and experimental treatment.

Comparison with Existing Methods
Our method is a significant improvement of previously described methods. Six morphometric parameters are quantified, providing a gestalt analysis of mitochondrial morphology. Also it can target specific populations of mitochondria using immunofluorescence assay and image analysis.

Conclusions
We found that our method adequately detects differences in mitochondrial morphology between treatment groups. We conclude that some parameters may be unique to a mutation or a disease state, and the relationship between parameters is altered by experimental treatment. We suggest at least four variables should be considered when using mitochondrial structure as an experimental endpoint.},

The impact of optical and electron microscopy techniques is enormous in all fields of biomedical research. It is possible that different research areas rely on microscopy in diverse ways. Here, we analyzed comparatively the use of microscopy in pharmacology and cell biology, among other biomedical sciences fields. We collected data from articles published in several major journals in these fields. We analyzed the frequency of use of different optical and electron microscopy techniques: bright field, phase contrast, differential interference contrast, polarization, conventional fluorescence, confocal, live cell imaging, super resolution, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and cryoelectron microscopy. Our analysis showed that the use of microscopy has a distinctive pattern in each research area, and that nearly half of the articles from pharmacology journals did not use any microscopy method, compared to the use of microscopy in almost all the articles from cell biology journals. The most frequent microscopy methods in all the journals in all areas were bright field and fluorescence (conventional and confocal). Again, the pattern of use was different: while the most used microscopy methods in pharmacology were bright field and conventional fluorescence, in cell biology the most used methods were conventional and confocal fluorescence, and live cell imaging. We observed that the combination of different microscopy techniques was more frequent in cell biology, with up to 6 methods in the same article. To correlate the use of microscopy with the research theme of each article, we analyzed the proportion of microscopy figures with the use of cell culture. We analyzed comparatively the vocabulary of each biomedical sciences field, by the identification of the most frequent words in the articles. The collection of data described here shows a vast difference in the use of microscopy among different fields of biomedical sciences.

              , published online 13 December) imaged actin in axons and dendrites using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. Surprisingly, while actin in dendrites formed long filaments, the actin in axons was organized into evenly spaced ringlike structures at the axon circumference. Spectrin, which is known to interact with actin to form a membrane cytoskeleton in erythrocytes, formed periodic structures that alternated with those of actin. This actin-spectrin cytoskeletal structure might give mechanical support to axons and could also organize other membrane proteins.

            Superresolution microscopy reveals a membrane cytoskeleton in neurons comprising rings of actin separated by spectrin.

            Actin and spectrin play important roles in neurons, but their organization in axons and dendrites remains unclear. We used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy to study the organization of actin, spectrin, and associated proteins in neurons. Actin formed ringlike structures that wrapped around the circumference of axons and were evenly spaced along axonal shafts with a periodicity of {\textasciitilde}180 to 190 nanometers. This periodic structure was not observed in dendrites, which instead contained long actin filaments running along dendritic shafts. Adducin, an actin-capping protein, colocalized with the actin rings. Spectrin exhibited periodic structures alternating with those of actin and adducin, and the distance between adjacent actin-adducin rings was comparable to the length of a spectrin tetramer. Sodium channels in axons were distributed in a periodic pattern coordinated with the underlying actin-spectrin–based cytoskeleton.},
