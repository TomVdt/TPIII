While {SMLM} imaging itself is becoming more popular, the computational analysis surrounding the technique is still a specialized area and often remains a “black box” for experimental researchers. Here, we provide an introduction to the required computational analysis of {SMLM} imaging, post-processing and typical data analysis. Importantly, user-friendly, ready-to-use and well-documented code in Python and {MATLAB} with exemplary data is provided as an interactive experience for the reader, as well as a starting point for further analysis. Our code is supplemented by descriptions of the computational problems and their implementation. We discuss the state of the art in computational methods and software suites used in {SMLM} imaging and data analysis. Finally, we give an outlook into further computational challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) uses conventional fluorescent probes such as labeled antibodies or chemical tags for subdiffraction resolution fluorescence imaging with a lateral resolution of ∼20 nm. In contrast to photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) with photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, dSTORM experiments start with bright fluorescent samples in which the fluorophores have to be transferred to a stable and reversible OFF state. The OFF state has a lifetime in the range of 100 milliseconds to several seconds after irradiation with light intensities low enough to ensure minimal photodestruction. Either spontaneously or photoinduced on irradiation with a second laser wavelength, a sparse subset of fluorophores is reactivated and their positions are precisely determined. Repetitive activation, localization and deactivation allow a temporal separation of spatially unresolved structures in a reconstructed image. Here we present a step-by-step protocol for dSTORM imaging in fixed and living cells on a wide-field fluorescence microscope, with standard fluorescent probes focusing especially on the photoinduced fine adjustment of the ratio of fluorophores residing in the ON and OFF states. Furthermore, we discuss labeling strategies, acquisition parameters, and temporal and spatial resolution. The ultimate step of data acquisition and data processing can be performed in seconds to minutes.},

The PSFs are expressed using the Debye integral. Under an L∞ constraint imposing peak matching, optimal and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With an L1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that (1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct use in practical applications.},

              Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has generated tremendous success in revealing detailed subcellular structures in animal cells. However, its application to plant cell biology remains extremely limited due to numerous technical challenges, including the generally high fluorescence background of plant cells and the presence of the cell wall. In the current study, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ({STORM}) imaging of intact
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              seedling roots with a spatial resolution of 20–40 nm was demonstrated. Using the super-resolution images, the spatial organization of cortical microtubules in different parts of a whole Arabidopsis root tip was analyzed quantitatively and the results show the dramatic differences in the density and spatial organization of cortical microtubules in cells of different differentiation stages or types. The method developed can be applied to plant cell biological processes, including imaging of additional elements of the cytoskeleton, organelle substructure and membrane domains.},

abstract = {Microtubules are one of the three components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and play a central role in many aspects of cell function, including cell division and cell motility. Electron microscopy, of both isolated microtubules and of microtubules in their cellular context, is an essential tool in understanding their structure and function. These studies have been particularly important because the size and heterogeneity of microtubules mean that they are not readily studied by other structural methods. Electron microscopy at different levels of detail can bridge the gap between atomic resolution structures solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR, and the dynamic but relatively coarse information that is achieved in light microscopy experiments. This chapter provides an overview of current approaches to studying microtubules by electron microscopy. Negative stain studies can be relatively quick and easy, and provide a useful overview of microtubules and their interactions prior to undertaking more complicated experiments such as high resolution structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy or reconstruction of unique cellular entities by electron tomography. As more microtubule-associated proteins are uncovered, EM studies will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how these proteins influence microtubules and where in the cytoskeleton they act.}

	abstract = {Recent advances in far-field optical nanoscopy have enabled fluorescence imaging with a spatial resolution of 20 to 50 nanometers. Multicolor super-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenging task. Here, we introduce a family of photo-switchable fluorescent probes and demonstrate multicolor stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ({STORM}). Each probe consists of a photo-switchable “reporter” fluorophore that can be cycled between fluorescent and dark states, and an “activator” that facilitates photo-activation of the reporter. Combinatorial pairing of reporters and activators allows the creation of probes with many distinct colors. Iterative, color-specific activation of sparse subsets of these probes allows their localization with nanometer accuracy, enabling the construction of a super-resolution {STORM} image. Using this approach, we demonstrate multicolor imaging of {DNA} model samples and mammalian cells with 20- to 30-nanometer resolution. This technique will facilitate direct visualization of molecular interactions at the nanometer scale.},
