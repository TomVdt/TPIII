\section{Theory and experimental setup}

\subsection{Epifluorescence Microscopes}
A common architecture for fluorescence microscopes is that of an upright epifluorescence microscope, pictured in \autoref{fig:epifluorescence_microscope}.

    \label{fig:epifluorescence_microscope}
\end{figure}

Light emitted from a source such as a laser or a high-intensity LED enters the microscope and is reflected into the objective lens by a dichroic mirror, capable of reflecting some wavelengths of light and transmitting others (a passband filter)\cite{douglass_notice_2023}.
The excitation light is then focused by the objective lens onto the studied sample, where it excites the fluorescent molecules therein\footnote{lol} present.
The fluorescent light emitted by the molecules is collimated by the same objective lens and passes again through the dichroic mirror, which therefore acts as a beam splitter, separating the excitation and emission light paths\cite{sachl_introduction_2022}.
Finally, a second lens, known as tube lens, focuses the parallel rays coming from the objective lens and forms the image of the sample on the camera or eyepiece.
This setup using two lenses, called an infinity-corrected system, allows to add or replace optical elements (such as filters or additional beamsplitters) in the space between the two lenses (the infinity space) without disturbing/modifying the wavefront of the light and thus keeping the same focus and magnification.

This mode of observation, where the excitation light is delivered to the specimen by the same objective lens which is used for collecting the fluorescence, 
is known as epi-illumination.
\hl{The following is cut and copy, modifier}It solves the problem of the excitation light dominating the weaker fluorescence signal, as most of the excitation light propagates away from the objective after leaving  the sample.

% THINGS WHICH CAN BE REMOVED IF SPACE IS NECESSARY:
% Epi-illumination iluminates the whole sample at once, in order to BLABLA. 
% Other illumination geometries include BLABLABLA.
% Also people use reversed epifluorescence microscopes which are better for this and that.


\subsection{The Point Spread Function}
All microscopes have a limited resolution for how small a point-like light source can appear. The shape of the point measured in through the microscope is described by the point spread function, or PSF, and caracterises the performance of a particular microscope. The light intensity $I(x, y)$ of point-like light sources as measured by the microscope can then be described as a convolution between the density of emitters $O(x, y)$ and the PSF:
\begin{equation}
    I(x, y) = \operatorname{PSF}(x, y) \star O(x, y)
\end{equation}
Under the assumption that the PSF is only influenced by the diffraction of light, its form can be found to be an Airy Disk, which is mathematically described by
\begin{equation}
    I(X) = I_0 \left[ \frac{2 J_1(X)}{X} \right]^{2}, \quad X = \frac{2\pi r \textrm{NA}}{\lambda}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the radial coordinate, NA is the numerical aperture of the optical system, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, and $J_1$ is the first order Bessel function of the first kind. The size or width of the PSF can then be defined by the first $0$ of the Airy disk, located at $\Delta X \approx 3.8317$, or $\Delta r \approx 0.61 \lambda / \textrm{NA}$.

\subsection{Single Molecule Localization Microscopy}
In most cases, the smallest object a fluerescence microscope can observe has a size of about half of the wavelength of light. However, a fluorescent molecule as observed through the microscope is \hl{with a certain degree of uncertainty or not?} located in the middle of the image it produces, that is, its PSF. By fitting the PSF to the image of a single molecule, its position can be estimated on the order of 10 nm for visible light \cite{douglass_notice_2023}, which is much more precise than what the wavelength by itself would allow. This technique is called Single Molecule Localization Microscopy, or SMLM. Multiple fitting techniques exist, each with their pros and cons. In this report, a two dimensional Gaussian will be fitted to the image, as an approximation of the Airy disk intensity function \cite{douglass_notice_2023}:
\begin{equation}
    f(x, y) = a \exp \left[ \frac{(x-\mu_x)^2 + (y-\mu_y)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right] + b
\end{equation}
where $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$ give the position of the molecule and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, which can be related to the wavelength and numerical aperture through \cite{zhang-appliedoptics-2007}
\begin{equation}
    \sigma \approx 0.21 \frac{\lambda}{\textrm{NA}}
    \label{eq:PSF_width_gaussian}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fluorescence Photophysics}
Fluorescence is a property of some substances describing their ability to capture photons and re-emit a photon of lower energy after a small duration. This phenomenon can be explained by the fluorescent particle transitioning from its ground state to an excited state, after which it relaxes to a lower energy state. The decay back to the ground state then causes the emission of a photon of a higher wavelength (and thus lower energy) than the excitation photon due to energy lost in the transition to a lower energy excited state. It is also possible for the fluorescent particle to decay without emitting a photon. These transitions usually happen on the order of $10^{-9}$ s \cite{douglass_notice_2023}.

Commonly, fluorophores have multiple energy levels to which the excited state can decay to, as depicted in \autoref{fig:energy_level_fluorophore}. For them to function properly, the fluorophores have to be mixed in a buffer that provides reagents for the fluorophores to return to their ground state. After being excited by an incident photon, there is a small probability that the fluorophore decays to a lower excited state depicted $^3\textrm F$. In this state, it can react with the compounds in the buffer to to either return to the ground state or reach a third excited state, the radical anion state. This state is quite unreactive and therefore has a long lifetime, much larger than the lifetime of the other states.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/alexafluor-jablonski-diagram.png}
    \caption{Energy level diagram of fluorophores from the Alexafluor and ATTO families \cite{vandelinde-natureprotocols-2011}}
    \label{fig:energy_level_fluorophore}
\end{figure}

In the radical anion state, the fluorophore can be considered "disabled" or \textsc{off}, as it does not fluoresce. Fluorophores that can fluoresce are refered to as being \textsc{on}. Some fluorophores may get stuck in an \textsc{off} state, a \textsc{bleached} state. \emph{Photoswitching} is a technique that aims to control the number of fluorophores in the \textsc{on} and \textsc{off} state, by modulating the compounds in the buffer, the light intensity, and through the use of different wavelengths, on the sample. This technique is the basis for STORM.
% \hl{mayybe epxliquer photoswitching car c'est à la base de tout ce qu'on a fait, surtout comme on devra discuter de l'action des différents lasers et UV.}

\subsection{STORM}
As a result (of the localization precision), two fluorescent molecules whose images overlap are impossible to localize.
The localization of dense distributions of emitters, such as fluorophores attached to cellular structures, must therefore be carried out with more [advanced] techniques than the [simple] capture of an image.
One such technique based on photoswitching \hl{check si on a déja parlé de photoswitching, sinon on inverse l'ordre} is stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).
It relies on the principle that we can localize all the fluorophores in an image by keeping only a subset(a part of it) switched on.
Then by capturing a high number of images (at minimum on the order of the 10,000), each with a stochastically determined subset of fluorophores switched on, and by localizing the molecules in each, a list of all resolved emitter positions can be obtained, from which a super-resolved image is rendered.

For this technique to be effective, the density of molecules being read out
(that is, in an emissive state) at the same time must stay low
enough for the distance between emitting molecules to be large
compared to the diﬀraction limit, so that individual fluorophores
can be spatially resolved \cite{furstenberg_single-molecule_2013}.
THIS IS DONE BY BALANCING THE POWER OF THE LASER (REF PHOTOSWITCHING AVANT)

\subsection{Image reconstruction}
\hl{On pourrait très rapidement expliquer ici comment on a obtenu les images, à la place de le dire en experimental setup, ça semble un peu plus théorique.
Suffit de remanier ce text en bas et citer l'article dont on a utilisé l'algorithme.}

% Once the positions of all the single fluorescence emitters have
% been determined, they can be used to reconstruct an image.
% Although this process seems trivial, many diﬀerent ways exist,
% the simplest being to draw every localization by a point of defined
% size and fixed intensity (binary scale). Such a map of coordinates
% is however often not a satisfactory way of representing the imaged
% structure, both for reasons of accuracy and aesthetics.
% Another way to depict position information in an image is to
% define a pixel grid with a predefined pixel size. Within each pixel,
% all positions are counted and this number is assigned as the
% intensity value of the pixel (2D-histogramming of the positions),87
% as shown in the examples in Fig. 4. Alternatively, each position
% can be plotted together with the position uncertainty or localiza-
% tion accuracy. For this, a normalized Gaussian intensity distribu-
% tion is drawn at the determined position. The standard deviation
% of this distribution equates the localization accuracy (blurring).36
% The image appears thereby less dotty; connected structures and
% increased spot densities are better recognizable. The structural
% resolution of the image is decreased by this method by a factor of
% O2 due to the unknown true position of the emitting molecule.
