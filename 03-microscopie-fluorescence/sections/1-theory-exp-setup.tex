\section{Theory and experimental setup}

\subsection{Epifluorescence Microscopes}
A common architecture for fluorescence microscopes is that of an upright epifluorescence microscope, pictured in \autoref{fig:epifluorescence_microscope}.

    \label{fig:epifluorescence_microscope}
\end{figure}

Light emitted from a source such as a laser or a high-intensity LED enters the microscope and is reflected into the objective lens by a dichroic mirror, capable of reflecting some wavelengths of light and transmitting others (a passband filter)\cite{douglass_notice_2023}.
The excitation light is then focused by the objective lens onto the studied sample, where it excites the fluorescent molecules therein\footnote{lol} present.
The fluorescent light emitted by the molecules is collimated by the same objective lens and passes again through the dichroic mirror, which therefore acts as a beam splitter, separating the excitation and emission light paths\cite{sachl_introduction_2022}.
Finally, a second lens, known as tube lens, focuses the parallel rays coming from the objective lens and forms the image of the sample on the camera or eyepiece.
This setup using two lenses, called an infinity-corrected system, allows to add or replace optical elements (such as filters or additional beamsplitters) in the space between the two lenses (the infinity space) without disturbing/modifying the wavefront of the light and thus keeping the same focus and magnification.

This mode of observation, where the excitation light is delivered to the specimen by the same objective lens which is used for collecting the fluorescence, 
is known as epi-illumination.
\hl{The following is cut and copy, modifier}It solves the problem of the excitation light dominating the weaker fluorescence signal, as most of the excitation light propagates away from the objective after leaving  the sample.

THINGS WHICH CAN BE REMOVED IF SPACE IS NECESSARY:
Epi-illumination iluminates the whole sample at once, in order to BLABLA. 
Other illumination geometries include BLABLABLA.
Also people use reversed epifluorescence microscopes which are better for this and that.

\subsection{Fluorescence Photophysics}
The behaviour of Fluorophores, the energetic states (rapidly), Photoswitching (not Photoactivation because that's used in PALM, but we're doing STORM)

\subsection{STORM} [mais on peut le mettre dans un autre paragraph] \\
As a result (of the localization precision), two fluorescent molecules whose images overlap are impossible to localize.
The localization of dense distributions of emitters, such as fluorophores attached to cellular structures, must therefore be carried out with more [advanced] techniques than the [simple] capture of an image.
One such technique based on photoswitching \hl{check si on a déja parlé de photoswitching, sinon on inverse l'ordre} is stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).
It relies on the principle that we can localize all the fluorophores in an image by keeping only a subset(a part of it) switched on.
Then by capturing a high number of images (at minimum on the order of the 10,000), each with a stochastically determined subset of fluorophores switched on, and by localizing the molecules in each, a list of all resolved emitter positions can be obtained, from which a super-resolved image is rendered.

For this technique to be effective, the density of molecules being read out
(that is, in an emissive state) at the same time must stay low
enough for the distance between emitting molecules to be large
compared to the diﬀraction limit, so that individual fluorophores
can be spatially resolved \cite{furstenberg_single-molecule_2013}.
THAT'S WHY WE BALANCE THINGS WITH LASER POWER AND BLABLA (MIEUX ÉCRIRE PHOTOSWITCHING AVANT)

\subsection{Image reconstruction [IDK SI ON A L'ÉSPACE ON PEUT FAIRE RESUMÉ DE ÇA]}
\hl{Cut and copy de }\cite{furstenberg_single-molecule_2013}
Once the positions of all the single fluorescence emitters have
been determined, they can be used to reconstruct an image.
Although this process seems trivial, many diﬀerent ways exist,
the simplest being to draw every localization by a point of defined
size and fixed intensity (binary scale). Such a map of coordinates
is however often not a satisfactory way of representing the imaged
structure, both for reasons of accuracy and aesthetics.
Another way to depict position information in an image is to
define a pixel grid with a predefined pixel size. Within each pixel,
all positions are counted and this number is assigned as the
intensity value of the pixel (2D-histogramming of the positions),87
as shown in the examples in Fig. 4. Alternatively, each position
can be plotted together with the position uncertainty or localiza-
tion accuracy. For this, a normalized Gaussian intensity distribu-
tion is drawn at the determined position. The standard deviation
of this distribution equates the localization accuracy (blurring).36
The image appears thereby less dotty; connected structures and
increased spot densities are better recognizable. The structural
resolution of the image is decreased by this method by a factor of
O2 due to the unknown true position of the emitting molecule.

\subsection{Experimental setup}
All results contained in this document were obtained using an Abbelight SAFe 180 Single Molecule Localization Microscope, an Oxxius ?? laser engine and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion digital CMOS camera.
Three different laser wavelengths were used: \mbox{488 nm}, \mbox{561 nm} and \mbox{647 nm}.

First, in order to test the performance of the microscope, the localization precision of single fluorescente molecules was estimated.
TetraSpeck\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} Microspheres, 0.1 $\mu$m diameter fluorescent beads.

Then STORM imaging of tubulin. Tubulin in COS7 cells labeled with AlexaFluor 647 fluorescent dye.

Then mitochondria, also using AlexaFluor 647 as fluorescent marker for the mitochondrial outer membrane in COS7 cells.

Software used:
Data acquisition was conducted using the NEO Live Imaging software, the localization precision study was conducted using a custom algorithm which made use of the \software{Scipy} Python package, while the STORM data was analysed with the NEO Analysis software and then imaged [as described in \cite{martens_raw_2022}].

Selected quotes from \cite{furstenberg_single-molecule_2013}:
\begin{quote}
    Super-resolution methods that combine photoswitchable
    fluorophores with single-molecule imaging achieve their superior
    spatial resolution by temporally breaking down the total fluores-
    cence into pieces in which the signal level allows single emitters to
    be observed. To that end, the density of molecules being read out
    (that is, in an emissive state) at the same time must stay low
    enough for the distance between emitting molecules to be large
    compared to the diﬀraction limit, so that individual fluorophores
    can be spatially resolved. \cite{furstenberg_single-molecule_2013}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
    In essence, single-molecule localization microscopy relies on
    three basic points (Fig. 3): (i) the use of photoswitchable
    fluorescent probes, (ii) the repeated detection of many isolated
    emitters and the determination of their position (localization),
    and (iii) the generation of a super-resolution image from single-
    molecule localization data. In each imaging frame, only few
    molecules are allowed to reside in their fluorescent state
    (‘‘on’’ state), so that single emitters can be spatially resolved
    and localized despite a high labelling density. The majority of
    the labels are kept in their non-fluorescent state (‘‘oﬀ’’ state) in
    a stochastic way, most commonly dependent on the irradiation
    intensity or a chemical reagent. The contrast between the on
    and oﬀ states is crucial as the signal-to-background ratio will
    determine the precision of the localization. \cite{furstenberg_single-molecule_2013}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
    The simplest
    approach for estimating the lateral position (x, y) of an emitter
    is to calculate the intensity-weighted centroid of the detected
    intensity distribution. Another possibility is to fit a model
    function that resembles the point-spread function (PSF) of
    the microscope system to the detected intensity distribution
    of single emitters. Two-dimensional Gaussian normal distribu-
    tions or a radial Airy pattern are frequently chosen as model
    functions. The fitting can be performed either by least-squares
    minimization or by maximum likelihood estimation algo-
    rithms.71,73,74 A third method is the correlation of the data
    with a known intensity distribution of the microscope PSF. \cite{furstenberg_single-molecule_2013}
