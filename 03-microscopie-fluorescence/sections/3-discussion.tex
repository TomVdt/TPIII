\section{Discussion}
\paragraph{Experimental PSF was higher than theoretical}
The beads are old (which can be deduced from the fact that the beads do not blink).
As a consequence, they are not a good estimate for the resolution of the microscope.

\paragraph{drifting}
\cite{martens_raw_2022} talks a lot about drifting, might be interesting

\paragraph{Diameter of microtubules}
\verb|INSERT PLENTY OF BIOLOGY| \\
larger than expected, show how most articles find good thing but that one has our same stuff idk why

\paragraph{Diameter of mitochondria}

\paragraph{effect of laser, uv, different wavelengths}

\paragraph{Acquisition parameters}
exposure time, number of frame, drift correction(not necessary in our case because of short time scale), filtering
