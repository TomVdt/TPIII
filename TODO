Multi-color STORM is not as straightforward, as it is a
challenge to nd two distinct uorophores that have good blinking
characteristics in the same environment, and inducing photoswitching
of uorophores outside of the far-red channel usually require high laser
power illumination

COS-7 cells frequently fail to properly divide and have a
signi cant population of multi-nucleated cells

images obtained compatible with [source] (both for tubulin and clathrin)

Multi-color STORM is not as straightforward, as it is a
challenge to nd two distinct uorophores that have good blinking
characteristics in the same environment, and inducing photoswitching
of uorophores outside of the far-red channel usually require high laser
power illumination

We use PAINT rather than STORM for multicolor imaging, as we
found it di cult to get reliably good blinking using a second uor-
ophore spectrally distinct from Alexa Fluor 647

The Gaussian ren-
dering with individual precision values is more complex to generate but
leads to the most precise reconstructions

microtubule width around 48/51 nm, way less then us.

from 10.1038/srep15694
other microtubule width

from 10.1364/OPTICA.4.001277
WIDTH LIKE US WIDTH LIKE US

On a plus grand width mais peut-être on observe bundle??
En effet la source 10.1364/OPTICA.4.001277 dit que oui, c'est comme nous, mais en regardant DEUX microtubules qui se croisent.
Le même dans 10.1038/srep15694, c'est un bundle.
La source dit:
Space between individual microtubule filaments varies from 50–120 nm in animal cells and 20–40 nm in
Arabidopsis cells depending on the crosslinking structures. The separation distance is larger as a result of
broadening effects due to antibody sizes and the spatial resolution.
