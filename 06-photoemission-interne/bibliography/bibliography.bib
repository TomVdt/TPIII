The I-V and C-V characteristics of the diodes have been measured in the temperature range of 80–400 K with steps of 20 K. Thermal carrier concentration and barrier height versus temperature plots have been obtained from the C−2-V characteristics, and a value of α=−1.40 {meV}/K for temperature coefficient of the barrier height. The modified activation energy plot according to the barrier inhomogeneity model has given the Richardson constant A∗ as 80 or 85 A/(cm2 K2).},

The Schottky barrier heights evaluated from forward current-voltage measurement revealed an increase of Schottky barrier height and series resistance but a decrease of ideality factor (n) with increasing temperature. However, the Schottky barrier heights evaluated from capacitance-voltage measurement remained almost the same throughout the temperature range measured. The Richardson constant extrapolated from ln(J0∕T2) vs 1∕T plot was found to be 0.029Acm−2K−2. A modified Richardson plot with ln(J0∕T2) vs 1∕{nT} showed better linearity, and the corresponding effective Richardson constant was 35Acm−2K−2. The device showed a high reverse breakdown voltage of 560V at room temperature. The negative temperature coefficients were found for reverse breakdown voltage, which is indicative of a defect-assisted breakdown.},
