\section{Results}
\subsection{I-V curves}
Measures were conducted at temperatures between $124 \pm ?$ and $296\pm?$ K. 
The current-voltage curves acquired and their respective fits are depicted in \autoref{fig:iv-curves}.
\hl{The maximal current reached ranges from blabla to blabla}.
The barrier height $\Phi_b$ as a function of temperature, extrapolated from \autoref{eq:thermionic_emission_current}, is depicted in \autoref{fig:iv-barrier-height}.
It appears to rise monotonically with the temperature, ranging from $\sim 0.2 \pm ??$ eV at $\sim 125 \pm ??$ K to $\sim 0.5 \pm ??$ eV at $\sim 300 \pm ??$ K
