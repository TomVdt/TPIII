\subsection{I-V curves}
\hl{Je n'arrive pas Ã  choisir} 
A total of 38 current-voltage curves were acquired at temperatures between $124 \pm ?$ and $296\pm?$ K (see \autoref{fig:iv-curves}). OR

Measures were conducted at temperatures between $124 \pm ?$ and $296\pm?$ K. 
The current-voltage curves acquired (38 in total) are depicted in \autoref{fig:iv-curves}.

The barrier height $\phi_b$ as a function of temperature, extrapolated from \autoref{eq:IV-curve}, is depicted in \autoref{fig:iv-barrier-height}
