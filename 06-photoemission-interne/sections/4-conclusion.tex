\section{Conclusion}
The main result of this work was the discovery of dangerous pressure buildup in large, air-tight liquid nitrogen containers.
Indeed, it was observed that seemingly small differences in pressure with respect to ambient pressure have the capacity of causing a loud boom and life-long trauma in fellow collegues.
