\section{Discussion}
What has been neglected in this line of reasoning is the fact that all of these theories assume that the SBH under study is homogeneous.
light by recent experiments is that all SBs, except those made of high quality epitaxial interfaces,
contain some degree of inhomogeneity \cite{tung_recent_2001}.

an apparent increase in
the ideality factor has been attributed to the effects
such as inhomogeneities of thickness, non uniformity of
the interfacial charges and insulator layer between
metal and semiconductor. These give rise to an extra
current such that the over all characteristics still
remain consistent with the thermionic emission
processes \cite{dhimmar_analysis_2016}
