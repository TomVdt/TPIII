\section{Discussion}
What has been neglected in this line of reasoning is the fact that all of these theories assume that the SBH under study is homogeneous.
light by recent experiments is that all SBs, except those made of high quality epitaxial interfaces,
contain some degree of inhomogeneity \cite{tung_recent_2001}.
