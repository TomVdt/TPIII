\section{Conclusion}
This study of a cold plasma through the use of langmuir probes has allowed us to find properties of the plasma such as electron temperature and density under different conditions. The propagation of ion acoustic waves was also tried as a method of finding the electron temperature.

Possible further studies would be ... (TODO: do this as a short conclusion?)
