\section{Conclusion}
To summarise, this study of a cold plasma through the use of langmuir probes has allowed us to find properties of the plasma such as electron temperature and density under different conditions. The propagation of ion acoustic waves was also tried as a method of finding the electron temperature.

As a further study we could try a setup with  a probe being able to move in 2 dimentsions to allow for the creation of a full temperature and density profile. This could then be studied under different chamber geometries to study the effects of the edges.

A higher number of probes would also be very useful to see the propagation of ion-acoustic waves

It would be interesting to use mixtures of different gas species and see how different [quantities] vary the properties of plasma.
