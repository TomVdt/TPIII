\section{Conclusion}
This study of a cold plasma through the use of langmuir probes has allowed us to find properties of the plasma such as electron temperature and density under different conditions. The propagation of ion acoustic waves was also tried as a method of finding the electron temperature.

Further studies could include a setup allowing a probe to move in 2 or 3 dimensions would allow to make a complete profile of the plasma and would possibly show how the plasma falls of close to the edges, near the grill or near the heating filament.

A higher number of probes, as is often done in practice, would allow for a higher measurement precision or an analysis of the propagation of ion-acoustic waves. This Multi-Needle Langmuir probe is similar to the probe on the NorSat-1 satellite.

It would be interesting to use mixtures of different gas species and see how different [quantities] vary the properties of plasma.
