\subsection{Change with pressure}
When the gas
pressure in the chamber increases, it causes an
increase in the number of collisions between the elec
trons and the other plasma species. As a result, the
energy transferred from the electrons to the plasma
species increases, causing a decrease in the electron
temperature by increasing the gas pressure
