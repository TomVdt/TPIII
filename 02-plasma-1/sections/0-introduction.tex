\section{Introduction}
% Heating an ionised gas in your kitchen oven is widely considered a bad idea, but if carried out with a good enough level of confidence it can bring to plasma physics research.
% In this paper,

% \cite{piel_plasma_2017} has a very thorough historical introduction, in Section 1.1.

% \cite{chen_introduction_2006} 1.7 has several applications of plasma physics.
% Keeping in mind the book was written in 1974, we can take these as general applications and then do further research.
% It would be interesting for example to study how plasma is  used for particle accelleration.

% Title: "Plasma [] analysis using Langmuir probes"

Hi, I'm Tom and `I'm Matteo` and today we will be presenting the results of our analysis of an Argon plasma using Langmuir probes.

To start of, we need to introduce plasmas. Plasmas are <Slide 1>

Langmuir probes are used today, and are very useful in space weather forecast, which allows us to predict and analyse solar flares for example. Solar events have a potentially destructive effects on our communications system and interfere with our GPS systems. A future mission plans on adding a Langmuir probe to the ISS. The data from these probes is of particular interest because of the ability it gives us to predict future solar events and to design more resilient satelites
