\section{Introduction}
Heating an ionised gas in your kitchen oven is widely considered a bad idea, but if carried out with a good enough level of confidence it can bring to plasma physics research.
In this paper,

\cite{piel_plasma_2017} has a very thorough historical introduction, in Section 1.1.

\cite{chen_introduction_2006} 1.7 has several applications of plasma physics.
Keeping in mind the book was written in 1974, we can take these as general applications and then do further research.
It would be interesting for example to study how plasma is  used for particle accelleration.
