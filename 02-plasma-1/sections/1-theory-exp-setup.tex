\section{Theory and experimental setup}

\subsection{General explanation about plasma}
"Gas is a quasinatural \ldots collective behaviour" (Livre Chen a une jolie d√©finition).
Though every gas always has a small degree of ionisation, plasma [is much cooler].

Explain concept of Debye sphere and length, ion and electron temperature and the difference between "hot" and "cold" plasma/


\subsection{Langmuir probes}
\paragraph{How they work}
"Bare wire or metal disk \ldots" to collect electrons.
Explain why they're useful (measure plasma temperature and density in a point).

\paragraph{The I-V characteristic curve}
Explain the different regions and why they have this form.
Give the formulas.
Figure with the different regions.


\subsection{Ion-acustic waves}
Plasma goes boing boing.

\subsection{Experimental setup}
We have a chamber and two probes (one like this, the other like that) and a bunch of voltage sources.
Also two tungsten filaments to heat the whole thing up.
With two voltage sources attached.
Also the grill and the cage and the whole thing is grounded but not really.

And here a very nice figure with the schematics of the setup.
