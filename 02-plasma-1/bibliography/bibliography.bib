              The electrical parameters of H

              /Ar plasma in a cylindrical inductive discharge with an expansion region are investigated by a Langmuir probe, where Ar fractions range from 0\% to 100\%. The influence of gas composition and pressure on electron density, the effective electron temperature and the electron energy probability functions ({EEPFs}) at different spatial positions are present. In driver region, with the introduction of a small amount of Ar at 0.3 Pa, there is a rapid increase in electron density accompanied by a decrease in the effective electron temperature. Additionally, the shape of the {EEPF} transitions from a three-temperature distribution to a bi-Maxwellian distribution due to an increase in electron–electron collision. However, this phenomenon resulting from the changes in gas composition vanishes at 5 Pa due to the prior depletion of energetic electrons caused by the increase in pressure during hydrogen discharge. The {EEPFs} for the total energy in expansion region is coincident to these in the driver region at 0.3 Pa, as do the patterns of electron density variation between these two regions for differing Ar fractions. At 5 Pa, as the discharge transitions from H
              2
              to Ar, the {EEPFs} evolved from a bi-Maxwellian distribution with pronounced low energy electrons to a Maxwellian distribution in expansion region. This evolve may be attributed to a reduction in molecular vibrational excitation reactions of electrons during transport and the transition from localized electron dynamics in hydrogen discharge to non-localized electron dynamics in argon discharge. In order to validate the experimental results, we use the {COMSOL} simulation software to calculate electrical parameters under the same conditions. The evolution and spatial distribution of the electrical parameters of the simulation results agree well with the trend of the experimental results.},

	abstract = {On July 14th, 2017, the first Norwegian scientific satellite {NorSat}-1 was launched into a high-inclination (98∘), low-Earth orbit (600 km altitude) from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. As part of the payload package, {NorSat}-1 carries the multi-needle Langmuir probe (m-{NLP}) instrument which is capable of sampling the electron density at a rate up to 1 {kHz}, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to continuously resolve ionospheric plasma density structures down to a few meters. Over the coming years, {NorSat}-1 will cross the equatorial and polar regions twice every 90 minutes, providing a wealth of data that will help to better understand the mechanisms that dissipate energy input from larger spatial scales by creating small-scale plasma density structures within the ionosphere. In this paper we describe the m-{NLP} system on board {NorSat}-1 and present some first results from the instrument commissioning phase. We show that the m-{NLP} instrument performs as expected and highlight its unique capabilities at resolving small-scale ionospheric plasma density structures.},
