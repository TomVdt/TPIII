	To simplify the sample collection and measurement procedures before draining, the specific activity conversion coefficient for converting 
	a measured value from a 1.5″ NaI (Tl) detector installed on a tank into specific activity was calculated. 
	The experimental calibration was performed in a test water tank with a volume of 14 L filled with diluted reference source 18F, 
	which is most commonly used in hospitals. The specific activity of the test water was measured with a gamma spectroscopy system 
	using a high-purity germanium detector calibrated with certified reference materials. The change in the conversion coefficient 
	according to the change in the volume of the water tank was corrected based on a Monte Carlo calculation. Finally, it was determined 
	whether the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of this system was lower than that of the draining standard. The counts for the specific 
	activity conversion factor and MDA were evaluated as 5.5389 × 1010 and 2.09 × 105 for 18F and for the one-hour count, respectively. 
	The MDA was lower than the standard value. Thus, this system can be used for discharge determination.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Environmental radioactivity analysis has been carried out to determine the level of environmental radioactivity and the potential radiological hazards at Tanjung Enim’s coal mine. 
		  Gamma spectroscopy method has been carried out to identify radionuclides and their types of activity. 
		  The results of radionuclide concentration are used to determine the radiological hazard index 
		  and become input data for the Residual Radioactivity Onsite 7.2 application to determine the dose rate 
		  and long-term cancer potential received by workers in coal mines. 
		  The results obtained for the average concentration of radionuclide activity in coal samples are 
		  226Ra, 232Th, and 40K are 72.468 Bq/kg, 86.905 Bq/kg, and 1802.049 Bq/kg, respectively. 
		  While the soil samples 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K respectively 79.205 Bq/kg, 100.209 Bq/kg, and 1443.275 Bq/kg. 
		  The radionuclide concentrations of both samples exceeded the UNSCEAR and worldwide reported averages for coal and soil. 
		  The average radiological hazard index for coal samples, namely Raeq, Hin, and Hex, was 335.500 Bq/kg, 1.102, 0.906, respectively. 
		  While the soil samples were 333.636 Bq/kg, 1.115, and 0.901, respectively. 
		  The index parameter is already lower than the UNSCEAR recommendation except for Hin, so there is a potential radiological hazard in internal pathways such as respiratory and digestive organs for mining workers. 
		  The total annual effective dose rate based on 5 RESRAD-Onsite 7.2 pathways, namely 
		  external gamma, inhalation, radon, soil ingestion, and drinking water, is 1.675 mSv/year, exceeding the dose limits determined by ICRP, 1 mSv/year. 
		  The ELCR is 6.625×10-3 which exceeds the UNSCEAR recommendation, 2.4×10-4. Based on the results, it is necessary to intervene in the mining environment of the Tanjung Enim’s coal mine.},
