P-values are a key concept in statistical hypothesis testing, used to help determine the strength of the evidence against a null hypothesis. Here's how to interpret them:
1. Definition of P-value:

A p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis (H0H0​) is true. In other words, it quantifies how likely it is to get the observed data (or something more extreme) purely by chance if the null hypothesis is correct.
2. Interpretation:

    Small p-value (typically ≤0.05≤0.05): There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis. In this case, the observed data is unlikely under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
    Large p-value (typically >0.05>0.05): There is weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject it. This means the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis, and any deviation from the null is likely due to random chance.
    Threshold (alpha, αα): The p-value is compared against a pre-determined significance level (usually 0.05) to make decisions. If p≤αp≤α, the null hypothesis is rejected.

3. Common Misinterpretations:

    Not the probability that the null hypothesis is true: The p-value does not indicate the likelihood that H0H0​ is true or false. It only describes the probability of the observed data given that H0H0​ is assumed true.
    Not a measure of practical significance: A small p-value indicates statistical significance, but it doesn’t imply the effect size or practical importance of the result. Even very small effects can produce tiny p-values if the sample size is large enough.
    Not proof: A p-value alone doesn’t prove or disprove a hypothesis. It only provides evidence, and results should be interpreted within the context of the study.

4. Example:

Suppose you're testing whether a new drug lowers blood pressure compared to a placebo. Your null hypothesis (H0H0​) is that the drug has no effect on blood pressure (i.e., the difference is zero). After conducting the test, you calculate a p-value of 0.02.

    Since 0.02 is less than the common threshold of 0.05, you reject H0H0​ and conclude that the drug likely has an effect on blood pressure.
    However, this doesn't mean there's a 98% chance the drug works—it just means that, assuming the drug had no effect, the probability of getting the observed data (or something more extreme) by random chance is 2%.

In summary, the p-value helps assess whether the evidence in your data is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis, but it must be interpreted carefully and within the broader context of the study's design and results.
