\section{Results}
The spectra were obtained

[Calibration] was then necessary,
in order [to derive the linear relationship] between [the channels] of the Multi Channel Analyser (MCA) thingy in which signal is detected 
and the corresponding energy values

This was accomplished using the known decay schems of the four sources.
