\section{Theory}
\paragraph{Gamma decay}
Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atom[nucleus?] transitions to a more stable form through the emission of energy by radiation.
Decay occurs in three main forms[kinds], each associated with a radiation of different nature and properties: $\alpha$-decay, $\beta$-decay and $\gamma$-decay.

$\alpha$-decay represents the disintegration of a parent nucleus to a daughter through the emission of a nucleus of a helium atom (an $\alpha$ particle).\footnote{\hl{Maybe more info on alpha decay?}}
$\beta$-decay is the transformation of a nucleus with an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons into a stabler one by emitting an electron ($\beta^-$ particle), in the case of a proton-rich nucleus, or a positron ($\beta^+$ particle), in the case of an over-abundance of neutrons.
Additionally, a proton-rich nucleus can also reduce its charge by the absorption of an atomic electron, in a process called \emph{electron capture}.
The electron comes most often from the inner $K$-shell, resulting in the outer electrons cascading down to fill the lower levels and emitting [one or more] X-rays\cite{intro_nuclear_particle_physics}.

$\gamma$-decay, on the other hand, occurs mainly[for the most part] right after a heavy nucleus desintegrates by emitting an $\alpha$ particle or a $\beta$ particle.
The daughter nucleus may be left in an excited state, from which[and] it can deexcite by rearranging the structure of the nuclear shells, 
a process which is tied to the emission of a high-energy photon (a $\gamma$ ray).

[The typical energies of nuclear $\gamma$-rays range from a fraction to several MeV.]

\paragraph{Scintillation detector}
Scintillation detectors are based on the properties of scintillators, materials that emit photons in the visible spectrum after the passage of a charged particle.
The scintillators used for particle detection are primarily [split] between two types: organic (or plastic), in which the photon emission has molecular origin, 
and inorganic (or crystalline), crystals which are doped with activators that can first be excited by electron-hole pairs 
produced by the charged particle passing in the crystal lattice\footnotemark\ and then de-excited by photon emission\cite{intro_nuclear_particle_physics}.

Because of the low intensity of the emitted light, the photon signal must be amplified in order to be properly counted.
This amplification is commonly achieved through the use of photomultiplier tubes (PMT), a device which converts the photon signal in a detectable electric pulse.
It consists of a vacuum chamber containing several components, pictured in Fig. \ref{fig:photomultiplier}: 
after passing a transparent entry window, adjacent to the scintillator, the scintillation photons first encounter a photocatode, 
where they produce an electron by photoelectric effect with a certain probability $\varepsilon$ (the quantum efficacy).
Next, a series of dynodes accellerate the electrons and multiply them through secondary emission.
The anode located at the end of the chamber then allows to read the amplified electric signal, 
which results linearly proportional to the amount of light incident on the photocathode.
The voltage applied between cathode and anode determines the value of the total gain $G$.

\paragraph{Gamma spectrometry}
WHAT IS THE GAMMA SPECTRUM?

When $\gamma$ rays enter the scintillator, they can interact in two possible ways: through the photoelectric effect or through Compton scattering.
Any photon converted to an electron by photoelectric effect generally deposits its entire energy within the scintillator, such that the intensity of the subsequent scintillation light is proportional to the energy of the original photon.
In the case of Compton scattering, instead, the photons do not deposit all of their energy and, once scattered, can produce new interactions.
A third way would be through $e^+ e^-$ pair production, but it is very unlikely\footnote{'Which is however very unlikely'?} for low-energy photons.

[The energy deposited in the NaI will therefore have two kinds of contributions to the $\gamma$ spectrum.
First, the full energies of any of the photons that convert into photoelectrons, and, second, a continuous spectrum of energies related to Compton scattering] \hl{$<$-- remanier un peu}

\paragraph{Attenuation in matter}
The [three ways in which photons interact with matter] cause an attenuation of $\gamma$ radiation, i.e. a progressive reduction in the number of photons, without a loss of their individual energy.
This phenomenon follows an exponential law and can be described in terms of a linear attenuation coefficient $\mu$, which depends on the energy of the incident light and the nature of the material.
In fact, let $I(x)$ be the intensity of photons at any point $x$ in the medium.
The change in intensity $dI$ in an infinitesimal thickness of material $dx$ can be written in terms of $\mu$ as follow:
\begin{equation}
    dI = I(x + dx) - I(x) = -\mu(E_{\gamma}, Z) I(x) dx
\end{equation}
where the negative sign indicates that the intensity decreases with travel.
Integrating the previous expression yields the attenuation law
\begin{equation} \label{eq:attenuation_law}
    I(x) = I_0 e^{-\mu(E_{\gamma}, Z) \, x}
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the value of the intensity at $x=0$. 
The law can also be put in a different form:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:attenuation_law_density}
    I(x) = I_0 e^{-\mu_d(E_{\gamma}, Z) \, d}
\end{equation}
where, if $\rho$ is the density of the material, $\mu_d = \mu / \rho$ is its mass attenuation coefficient and $d = \rho \cdot x$ its surface density.

\subsubsection{Coincidences}

\end{figure}

To detect desintegrations that cascade from another excited state, the setup shown in Fig. \ref{fig:setup_coincidences} is used. Two scintillators, I and II are placed on opposite sides of the sample to study. A coincidence occurs whenever an event is measured simultaneously in both detectors. The maximum time resulution \(2 \theta\) is then defined as the maximal time difference between the two impulses from the scintillators.
\begin{equation}
    2 \theta = \theta_I + \theta_{II}
