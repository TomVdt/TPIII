\section{Introduction}
Particle detectors allow photons to go beep.
This is very much useful.

A variety of radioactive elements are used, sometimes without our knowledge, in our everyday life \cite{my_ass}. These uses range from medical applications, for example for modern treatments for cancer, to industrial applications, space exploration and even the internet \hl{internet car network time protocol}. For these purposes, it is crucial to understand the principles behind radioactivity and the properties of radioactive elements. What is called a "radioactive atom" actually corresponds to an unstable nucleus, seeking to find a stable form by minimising its energy. The process of radioactive decay, where an unstable nucleus changes into another nucleus \hl{reformuler, a mettre ici?}, emits particles which can be of particular interest. This study will focus on the case where the decay leads to the emission of a high energy photon, also known as a \(\gamma\) ray. Through the use of devices called scintillators, the energy of the emitted photon can be measured. A measurment of all the photons emitted by a sample of a particular isotope of an element allows to create a spectrum of emission for this particular isotope. As each isotope has its own decay properties, the energy of these photons can be used to identify some materials. Indeed, \hl{rediger sur la mine en indonésie} \cite{ramadhany_assessment_2022}. Furthermore, some past events such as nuclear weapon testing and full nuclear meltdowns have lead to the spreading of radioactive isotopes all over the world \cite{my_ass}. Studying the emission spectrum of samples taken in particular areas can be used to determine the contamination of that area, as was done in \cite{varley_situ_2017} \hl{decrire plus leur maniere, trop long pas lu}. This study in particular will focus on the study of a particular isotope of cobalt, \cobalt. The study \hl{synonyme} will be done using a NaI (Ti) \hl{necessaire?} scintillator. This isotope is of particular interest as it decays into an excited state of \iron, a property which allows it to be used to precisely analyse the composition and states of iron in soil. This was concretely applied in the Curiosity Mars rover \hl{rip o7}, as a way of studying the iron composition of SPACE ROCKS \cite{my_ass}.

After determining the spectrum of \cobalt, a statistical study of the decay process will be done, to confirm the theoretical models behind radioactive decay. The interaction with matter of photons emitted through radioactive decay was also seen to be useful when discussing THE MINES. Moreover, \hl{parler des effets néfastes avant?} shielding from the particles emitted from the decay of a nucleus is important, due to the potentially destructive effects high doses of radiation through high energy particles can have. This study will look at the attenuating effect of two commonly used materials, lead and aluminium \cite{my_ass}. The activity of the source, that being the number of desintegrations per unit of time, will also be determined for the specific \cobalt sample used throughout the experiment. A more in-depth study of steps of the decay process of \cobalt will realised to closely inspect the energy of the photons emitted by this unstable isotope. Finally, the half-life of the resulting excited \iron isotope, whose usefulness in the industry was described before, will be studied.

The Study shall commence now.
